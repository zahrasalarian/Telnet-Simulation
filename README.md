# Telnet-Simulation
A simple peer-to-peer telnet simulation where each system can be a client or a server.  
Many commands can be executed through it, such as uploading files, sending encrypted or unencrypted messages, executing commands on the other system, etc.  
SQLite was used to store Telnet command histories.
